1. Using the list of male samples and a list of chromosomes for which they have shared gvcfs, submit the script c1.mergevcf.sh to create merged gvcf files for each sample covering the shared chromosome data. 
2. Combine gvcfs across samples into a multigvcf using c2.CombineGVCFs.sh
3. Genotype multi-sample gvcf using c3.GenotypeGVCFs.sh
4. Filter genotyped multi-sample vcf using c4.vcftools_variant_filter.sh
5. Run relatedness using c5.relatedness.sh
6. Run NGSrelate using c6.ngsRelate.sh
