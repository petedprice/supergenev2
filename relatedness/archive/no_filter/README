1. Using the list of male samples and a list of chromosomes for which they have shared gvcfs, submit the script c1.mergevcf.sh to create merged gvcf files for each sample covering the shared chromosome data. 
2. Filter merged vcfs using c2.VariantFiltration.sh for depth and qualit 
3. Combine all sample vcfs into a multi-sample gvcf using c3.CombineGVCFs.sh
4. Genotype multi-sample gvcf using c4.GenotypeGVCFs.sh
5. Calculate relatedness using c5.relatedness.sh
